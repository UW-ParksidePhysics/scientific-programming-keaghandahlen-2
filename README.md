# In this python program I plan to find the distance between the Earth and the Sun. I plan on doing this by first changing time t into a variable that we can use. One of the simplest ways of doing this is by using the equation for eccentricity and converting time t in terms of radians. Once this is done, I will substitute phi into the eccentricity formula for distance at a given day. Therefore, I can find the distance between the Earth and the Sun at anytime in the year. However, if I wanted to find today’s distance I could use the datetime command to get today’s exact time and date. We then convert this to the number of days in the year. Once this is done, I would now be able to find the distance between the Earth and the Sun on today’s date. This code would be helpful for almost anyone. If I were to add more information about the distance between the Earth and Moon and Earth’s rotational speed, you could calculate just about anything related to eclipses and seasonal changes.
